# CunyFirst Course Schedule API

###About
My personal project to make scheduling classes each term a little less stressful.

After many version changes in the client code, a working build has finally been released for the Spring 2015 term. 
I can happily say that this program has successfully helped me schedule classes many times in the past.
You can view a sample execution of this program [here.](https://github.com/KevinRamsunder/CunyFirst-College-Course-API/blob/master/src/MainClassSearch.java)



###Features
This is a Java application that remotely queries CunyFirst course schedule table. 

The first major feature is allowing the user to access this information without user credentials, further streamlining the process.

Next, it allows users to specify customized search inputs based on CunyFirst's own search parameters. It is also able to access data such as the instructor, room, or time. 

The final main feature of this program is the ability to get notifications on changes in seat availability. Users can set alerts to alleviate the need of constantly checking if a class has open seats yet. 

###Future
One feature that is currently in development is the GUI for easy user interaction. At this time, the program runs off the inputs given by the user, which is not very user-friendly. A GUI will solve this problem, and will work similarly to my other project seen [here.](https://github.com/KevinRamsunder/coursera-downloader)

An Android application is also in development and it will mimic the features of this program. The development is ongoing, albeit rather slowly.


###Note
I have been working on this project since mid-2013. During this time, CunyFirst's client code has been constantly changing, and continues to do so today.
Each time, my code has to be refactored; this is the nature of web-scraping applications.
Luckily, I feel confident in the quality of this code to attest that is fairly straightforward to re-adapt the existing code to the new client code. 
I have done so many times at this point to get the program to work in time for course scheduling.
